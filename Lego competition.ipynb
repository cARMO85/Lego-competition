Additionally, a pattern can be observed between the years 2000-2016, where the average number of sets released per year is relatively consistent and higher compared to other years. This could indicate a change in the company's strategy or target audience during this period.\n","However, there are some outliers in the data, such as 1967, 1956, and 1950, where the average number of sets released per year is significantly lower than other years. These could potentially be attributed to production or financial difficulties, or the company focusing on other projects.\n","Furthermore, when analyzing the data by decade, a linear increase can be seen in the total number of sets released, indicating a steady growth in the company's production and releases over the years."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d039d019-07a6-4493-9962-a38f5ef5c06a","metadata":{},"source":["# 2.
